# Snake Game in Java

## Overview

This Snake Game is a simple yet engaging Java application. Developed by Ali Haydar, it revives the classic snake game where the player maneuvers a line (representing a snake), which grows in length as it consumes food. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen border or into itself.

## Features

- Simple, intuitive gameplay.
- Graphical user interface using Java Swing.
- Customizable game settings (like the size of the game unit, game speed, etc.).
- Score tracking.
- Restart and Exit functionality.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK installed on your machine.

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the Java files. You can use a command like:
   ```
   javac SnakeGame.java GameFrame.java GamePanel.java
   ```
3. Run the game using the command:
   ```
   java SnakeGame
   ```

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
- Consume food to increase the length of the snake.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's body.
- Try to score as high as possible.
